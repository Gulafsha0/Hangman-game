Task Domain: Python

Organization: CodeAlpha

Task: Create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this project is to:

=>Develop a basic text-based game using Python.

=>Practice working with control structures like while loops and if-else statements.

=>Understand how to manipulate strings and lists.

=>Use the random module to select a word randomly.

Create an interactive experience through console input/output.

ðŸ“– Explanation

Here's how the Hangman game works:

=>The game uses a small list of 5 predefined words.

=>One word is selected at random at the start of the game.

=>The player attempts to guess the word one letter at a time.

=>Correct guesses reveal the positions of the guessed letters in the word.

=>Incorrect guesses are counted and limited to 6 chances.

=>The game ends with either a win (all letters guessed) or a loss (6 incorrect guesses).
